"""The Workday fetcher, tested against real recorded GDIT responses.

Fixtures: workday_search.json, workday_job_detail.json, workday_robots.txt — all real.

Workday is the odd one out and the most valuable. It is where enterprise fintech and gov
contractors live (invisible to Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby), it has real server-side search, and
it makes us work for the data:
  * the search response is thin — no description, no salary, no date;
  * `postedOn` is a human sentence ("Posted 8 Days Ago"), so the real date needs a detail call;
  * `limit` caps at 20, and one GDIT query reports 1064 hits — hydrating everything would be
    54 search calls plus 1064 detail calls, so search and hydrate must be separable;
  * req ids are unique only WITHIN a tenant, so source_id must be namespaced.
