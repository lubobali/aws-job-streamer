"""The prefilter — a cheap, deterministic volume cut before the LLM.

Every case below is a REAL location string taken from a live board (97 distinct strings across
651 jobs from Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday and Adzuna). None are invented.

The prefilter's mistakes are invisible: a job it drops is never scored, never emailed, and
never missed-in-a-way-anyone-notices. So it only ever drops what it can PROVE is unusable.
