"""Workday — enterprise ATS, reached through the JSON API behind its public career sites.

    POST https://{tenant}.{wd}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}/jobs   (search)
    GET  https://{tenant}.{wd}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}{path}  (detail)

Why this module exists: probing 20 real employers found only 4 on Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby. Every
large one — Capital One, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Humana, GDIT, ManTech — is on an enterprise ATS.
Workday is where the fintech and gov-contractor roles actually live, so skipping it means missing
most of the market.

robots.txt permits this: `/wday/cxs/` is not disallowed and the career site is explicitly
`Allow`ed (only `/talentcommunity/` and `/refreshFacet/` are barred).

Workday makes us work for the data, and the shape of this module is a consequence:
  * search is thin — no description, no salary, no real date;
  * `postedOn` is prose ("Posted 8 Days Ago"); the real date is `startDate` on the detail call;
  * `limit` caps at 20 and one GDIT query reports 1064 hits, so hydrating everything would cost
    54 search calls plus 1064 detail calls. search() and hydrate() are therefore separate, and
    the caller prefilters cheap stubs before paying for detail.
