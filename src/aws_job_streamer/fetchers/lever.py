"""Lever — public job board API.

    GET https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{slug}?mode=json

No auth. Like Greenhouse there is no server-side search, so we fetch a board whole.

Three things differ from Greenhouse and each one costs a bug if missed:
  * the payload is a bare JSON list, not an object with a "jobs" key;
  * `createdAt` is epoch MILLIseconds, not seconds;
  * the posting body is split across `descriptionPlain`, `lists` and `additionalPlain` —
    the requirements live in `lists`, so the intro alone is not the posting.

The upside: Lever states `workplaceType` outright, so remote needs no guessing.
