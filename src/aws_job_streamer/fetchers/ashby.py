"""Ashby — public job board API.

    GET https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/{slug}?includeCompensation=true

No auth. No server-side search, so we fetch a board whole.

The richest source we have. Unlike Greenhouse and Lever it states `isRemote` outright, publishes
a clean ISO-8601 `publishedAt`, ships a complete `descriptionPlain`, and — uniquely — carries the
employer's own salary range. `includeCompensation=true` is required to get it.
