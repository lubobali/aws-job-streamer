"""Adzuna — aggregator with real keyword search.

    GET https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/us/search/{page}?app_id=..&app_key=..&what_phrase=..

The only source that can answer "who is hiring data engineers in Chicago?" without being handed
a company list first. That makes it our DISCOVERY tool: it finds companies not on the watchlist,
and their ATS board then gets watched properly. It is deliberately NOT the source of truth —
descriptions are truncated at 500 chars and two thirds of its salaries are invented.

Everything below was measured against the live API:
  * `what` is FUZZY — "data engineer" returns 91829 hits, matching "data" OR "engineer" loosely
    and surfacing "Manager of ETL Development" first. `what_phrase` returns 29378. We use the
    phrase; the fuzzy one would flood the digest.
  * `salary_is_predicted` is "1" for 34/50 live results — Adzuna guessed, always as a min==max
    point estimate ($119,026-$119,026). Never present that as fact.
  * `results_per_page` silently caps at 50: ask for 100, get 50, no error.
  * There is NO remote signal — every job is geocoded to a physical city.
  * The API intermittently answers 503 with a CloudFront HTML page.
  * `full_time=1` / `permanent=1` look useful but are traps: they cut 29378 -> 8556 / 412 because
    most postings are simply untagged, so filtering on them silently discards real jobs.
