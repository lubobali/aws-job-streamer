"""Greenhouse — public job board API.

    GET https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{token}/jobs?content=true

No auth, no approval: a company's board token is all it takes. There is no server-side
search, so we fetch a board whole and filter downstream.

Parsing is pure and IO is a thin shell around it, so the field mapping — the part that
actually breaks — is tested against a recorded board with no HTTP in the way.
