"""Remotive — a remote-jobs board with a real keyword search.

    GET https://remotive.com/api/remote-jobs?search=<phrase>

No auth. Every posting is remote, so this feeds the workable digest directly — the point of the
"catch more, miss nothing" phase: a tight location filter needs a wide remote funnel.

Everything below was measured against the live API:
  * The payload is an object with a `jobs` array, alongside attribution keys (`0-legal-notice`,
    `00-warning`). Read `jobs` only. Remotive's ToS asks for a link back — honoured in the digest.
  * **`candidate_required_location` region-locks most jobs.** Measured across data/AI/backend
    searches: 52 "Brazil", plus "Mexico", "Uruguay", "Europe"-only, etc. Only postings naming
    USA / Americas / North America / Worldwide are workable for a US candidate. This field becomes
    the job's `location`, so the prefilter (extended for remote regions) drops the rest.
  * `publication_date` is a naive ISO string ("2026-07-16T10:10:51") — stamped UTC here.
  * `salary` is a free-text employer string ("$80k - $100k", "$90 - $150 /hour") — real, not a
    prediction, so it is kept as-is and never flagged estimated.
