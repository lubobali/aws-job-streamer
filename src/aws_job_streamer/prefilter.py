"""A cheap, deterministic cut before anything expensive runs.

This module's mistakes are INVISIBLE. A job it drops is never scored, never emailed, and never
noticed — there is no error and no empty result to investigate. So it drops only what it can
prove is unusable, and geography is the only thing it can prove.

It deliberately does NOT filter on title. Both directions were measured against 651 real jobs:
  * a title ALLOW-list ("data" in title) hides 160 real matches — every "Applied AI Architect",
    "ML Systems Engineer", "Analytics Engineer" — and still lets through "Data Center Electrical
    Engineer", which is a building job. That is the exact filter that put a data-centre role in
    Lubo's first digest.
  * a title DENY-list saves only 32 of 480 LLM calls (6.7%), and after the dedup gate that is
    1-3 calls a day. It buys nothing and risks silently dropping a role whose title hides it —
    the "Software Engineer III" that is really a data platform job.
Titles are a weak signal (PLAN.md Phase 2). The LLM reads the JD body and judges. This just
stops us paying to read jobs on the wrong continent.

    Deliberately asymmetric, because the two mistakes are not equal. Dropping a real US job
    makes it invisible forever; keeping a foreign one costs one LLM call and one glance. So a
    posting is dropped ONLY when it names somewhere foreign and nowhere American.

    A US signal always wins. Real boards list one job across several countries, and
    "London, UK; Ontario, CAN; Remote-Friendly, United States; San Francisco, CA" is a job Lubo
    can take. It also settles the namesakes: "Paris, TX" is Texas, "Paris, France" is not.
