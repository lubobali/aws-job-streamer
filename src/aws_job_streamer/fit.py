"""Turn the LLM's facts into the ranked digest — the arithmetic half of Phase 2.

The division of labour is deliberate (LUBO'S RULES): the LLM in `scoring.py` READS a posting and
reports facts (score, workplace, office days, years required); every NUMBER and every DECISION
happens here, in plain Python that can be read and tested.

Two rules this module encodes, both learned from the 18 jobs Lubo actually applied to:

  * **The years wall is a Python decision from a reported number.** He applies to 1-3, 4-8, 5+
    and 6+ year roles; only 8+ is a real disqualifier. So the skip is computed from the LLM's
    `years_required` number, not from the LLM's opinion. Azure-mandatory and wrong-discipline are
    *semantic* judgements with no number to compute, so those come from the LLM's flags.

  * **Skips MARK, they never delete.** A wrongly-flagged job must still be inspectable, not vanish
    — the same anti-silent-drop discipline as the location ranker and the fetchers.

Ranking: **workability first, then fit score, then location tier, then freshness.** A job in a
place he cannot work — onsite/hybrid in a city he won't relocate to (OTHER_US) — sinks below every
workable role no matter how strong the skills match: a 92 in San Francisco he can't take must not
outrank a 72 remote role he can. It stays ranked and visible (never dropped) in case it flexes to
remote. WITHIN the workable band, fit score leads and location tier breaks ties, so a strong
Chicago or target-metro job still beats a weaker remote one — Lubo wants the best *jobs* among the
ones he could actually take. (Resolved 2026-07-17: a real SF-onsite 92 had been topping the digest
over remote roles; workability is now an explicit first-class sort term, not a tiebreaker.)
