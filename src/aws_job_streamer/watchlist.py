"""The curated company watchlist — WHO we fetch, the single biggest lever on digest quality.

Garbage-in beats any downstream filter: point the pipeline at companies whose work is Lubo's lane
(fintech/payments data teams, data-platform shops, AI/LLM-infra) and off-criteria jobs become rare
at the source. Every board here was **probe-verified** to return real jobs (PLAN.md Decision Log
#8: a 200 with an empty body is a 404 in disguise) — the slug and source are confirmed, not
guessed. Companies with no public ATS board (Symmetric, Workwhile, Logicbroker, dbt Labs, …) are
deliberately absent rather than listed dead.

The scorer and the 65-point digest floor decide relevance; this list decides the candidate pool.
