"""Rank jobs by Lubo's stated location preference.

His order, verbatim (2026-07-16):
  1. Remote 100%
  2. Hybrid in Sarasota / Tampa Bay FL   -- he would relocate immediately
  3. On-site in Sarasota County FL       -- he would relocate immediately
  4. Hybrid anywhere, office <= ~2x/month  -- he would fly in from Venice
  5. Chicago hybrid                      -- a temporary 6-12 month bridge, then he relocates

This module RANKS. It must never drop a job, and that is not a technicality: he would take a
Chicago hybrid, or a "two days a month" role in Denver. Filtering on location would hide
precisely the jobs he would accept, so the prefilter stays US-wide and preference only decides
what floats to the top.

Per LUBO'S RULES, ranking is arithmetic and therefore lives in Python. The LLM's job (Phase 2)
is to read a JD and report facts — is it hybrid, how many office days a month — never to rank.
